checkPasswd.c: Running the program prompts the user to enter a password. The password must contain the following criteria; an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, 
a number, and no group of three consecutive characters (ie: 123, abc). After entering the password, if the password meets the criteria a message will pop up stating the
password is safe. If two or more criteria are missing, a message will pop up stating that the password is unsafe as well as the point detracted from the password. 20
points are subtracted for every missing criteria and if more than 30 points are accrued the password is deemed unsafe.
