calcPrice.c is a very basic per-unit cost calculator. It asks for you to provide an item number, the cost of the item, the amount of said item and the date of purchase. 
From there it will calculate the total cost of all units purchased and display it in a tabular fashion.

getPhoneNumber.c asks for the user to input a phone number in the format of (999)999-9999 and then displays the number in 999-999-9999 format.
